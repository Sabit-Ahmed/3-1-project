	<h2>History of robotics:</h2>
	The history of robots has its origins on the ancient world. The modern concept began to be developed with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, which allowed the use of complex mechanics, and the subsequent introduction of electricity. This made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a humanoid machine was developed. Today, one can envisage human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement.
	The first uses of modern robots were in factories as industrial robots – simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less need for human assistance. Digitally controlled industrial robots and robots using artificial intelligence have been built since the 2000s.
	The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by William Grey Walter of the Burden Neurological Institute at Bristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as "tortoises" due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.

	Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation. Walter's work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden. Modern incarnations of Walter's "turtles" may be found in the form of BEAM robotics.[32]
	U.S. Patent 2,988,237, issued in 1961 to Devol.
	The first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by George Devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the Unimate. This later laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry.[33] Devol sold the first Unimate to General Motors in 1960, and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in Trenton, New Jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them.[34] Devol's patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry.[35]
	Technology is an expanded concept that deals with a species' usage and knowledge of tools and crafts, and how it affects a species' ability to control and adapt to its environment. In human civilization, it is a consequence of science and engineering, although several technological advances predate the formalization of these two disciplines. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas – examples include construction technology, medical technology, or state-of-the-art technology.
	The human race's use of technology began with the conversion of plentiful natural resources into simple tools. The prehistorical discovery of the ability to control fire increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear bombs.	
	
	The Robotic Society of RUET started in May 2006. It began with no huge investment but with a view to building a paragon of electro-mechanics. It organizes workshops, contests, seminars and more. RSR wants to play a vital role in the field of mechatronics and robotics. They are working to fulfill their goal.
	The latest achievement of Robotic Society of RUET was to make the first kind of robot that understands Bengali voice command
	
	<h2>debating club:</h2>
	During debating club, the pupils are split into teams and debate current relevant topics. The main aim for debating club enables pupils to develop their speaking and listening skills and ability to express themselves verbally in front of a group, which builds confidence. It helps them to develop their research skills as well as broadening their horizons and begin to explore big ethical questions. This is a popular club and some debates do get very lively!
	Debate clubs are formed within schools, universities, youth clubs and community centers. Although they are usually initiated at the school level, they can also be formed in community and youth centers in countries where political conditions make it difficult to work within the school system. These clubs may then function as an educational program offered by the particular institution.

	The debate club represents the heart of the IDEA mission. If successfully administered, these locally-based institutions will eventually flourish into independent national debate organizations, which hold membership in IDEA and are capable of upholding and promoting the principles of IDEA and of debate.
	 
	The Functions of the Debate Club:
	At the club level, debating teams, along with their coaches and other club members, prepare for tournaments and serve the broader school community. Parents, teachers, and community members are encouraged to participate as judges, fundraisers, and volunteers within the club program. Clubs sponsor local events such as public debates and strive to encourage the democratic exchange of ideas throughout the region. Debate clubs are as inclusive as possible (see starting a debate club for more on club composition), and students of differing ages, grades, and abilities are encouraged to participate and contribute to the club and its efforts.
	 
	Debate Clubs as the Foundation of Independent National Debate Organizations:
	The debate club serves as the starting point from which, ideally, an independent national debate organization will arise. IDEA works to initiate this process via a five-year program (program length may vary depending upon funding and other factors).
	 
	During the first year of the program, IDEA reaches out to secondary school teachers interested in debate. These initial trainees receive extensive instruction in the fundamentals of debate, along with information on how to create debate clubs in their schools. During the second year, a national training team is selected from those teachers first trained by IDEA; who are asked to begin developing a strategy for integrating debate into the curriculum of local schools.
	 
	 
	RUET Debating Club (RUET DC) is one of the most popular organizations of RUET. The motto of the organization is "Our Debate, Our Dream." Its anniversary is 4 May 1991. Its main purpose is building the culture of debating among students to make them expert in debate, presentation and leadership.
	
	
	<h3>Photographic Society of RUET (PSR)::</h3>
	The Photographic Society of RUET was created in 2002. This club was formed to deliver the best photographic potential from the students of Rajshahi Engineering University & Technology. This society works to bring closer all the photographers of RUET.

	<h2>Team Crack Platoon</h2>

		Crack Platoon is the gathering of some strongly motivated and highly enthusiastic youth committed to be the leader of a new revolution. 

		Flash Back:

		On the very beginning of our historic liberation war in 1971, the Pakistani Rulers could understand the importance of demolishing the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka. As destroying the captial would be very helpful for them to destroy the whole country.

		But, some youth came forward to make their plan a failure. They were known as “Crack Platoon”. Their duty was to design attacking plans for the enemy. Unfortunately, some of the members were caught by the Pakistani military and they were tortured violently but nothing could be revealed from them about the plans designed by the liberation war heroes. 

		Inspired from their patriotism, a group of highly enthusiastic youths felt their responsibilities to their motherland. 

		Finally, the day, November 9, 2015 was the day for these youth to be gathered with a view to working together for a better future. 

		THE TEAM CRACK PLATOON begins. 
		.
		Our Mission: 

		Team Crack Platoon is strongly focused on the improvement of the automobile sector in Bangladesh. Till now, there has been no self-contained automobile manufacturing company in our country. We gathered to break the silence in this challenging engineering sector. We want Bangladesh to be one of the leading car manufacturing countries of the world.

		Our team: 

		Crack Platoon has 23 hard-working and highly skilled personalities in number. They are from different fields of engineering like Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronics Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering and so forth. 

		Our Achievements: 

		Immediately after the formation of crack platoon, we have 
		already participated in various national and international competitions organized in home and abroad with prestigious recognitions. 

		1. We are the Regional Champion of Youth Fest 2016, Rajshahi. 

		2. Our team had been selected for the first round of Valeo Innovation Challenge 2016,France among 500 ideas from all over the world. 

		3. We are also qualified as the second round participant of upcoming SHELL ECOMARATHON ASIA 2016, going to be held in Singapore next year. 

		4. "The Best Passionate Team" & proudly upholding the "6th position" of Quad Bike Design Challenge- 2016 held on Pune, India organized by Fraternity of Mechanical & Automotive Engineers (FMAE), Delhi, India.

		5. This Year, Our team is going to participate in "Student Formula"- Japan-2017, as the final round participant in September . This competition is organized by Society of Autometive Engineers ( SAE ) 

		Our Goal: 

		The day will be our success when Bangladesh will be no more dependent on importing automobiles rather she will export world-class automobile vehicles all over the world. 

		Our moral is, ” they achieved our flag in 1971 
		Let’s wave with pride all over the world. ”

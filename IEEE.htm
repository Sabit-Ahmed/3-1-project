    <div class="cont"><h3>History of IEEE</h3>
    <p> IEEE, an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity, is the world’s largest technical professional society. It is designed to serve professionals involved in all aspects of the electrical, electronic, and computing fields and related areas of science and technology that underlie modern civilization. IEEE’s roots go back to 1884 when electricity began to become a major influence in society. There was one major established electrical industry, the telegraph, which since the 1840s had come to connect the world with a data communications system faster than the speed of transportation. The telephone and electric power and light industries had just gotten underway.  </p>

    <h3>Mission statement</h3>
    <p> IEEE's core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.</p>

    <h3>Vision statement</h3>
    <p>EEE will be essential to the global technical community and to technical professionals everywhere, and be universally recognized for the contributions of technology and of technical professionals in improving global conditions. view the IEEE Strategic plan IEEE RUET Student Branch presents seminar on “Fellowships & Scholarships in Australia via Endeavour” on 06 May, 2017 at ETE seminar room, ECE Building, RUET.
